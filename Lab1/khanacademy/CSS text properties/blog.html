        <h2 id="first-post">THE GOOD AND THE BAD OF NYC</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/View_of_Empire_State_Building_from_Rockefeller_Center_New_York_City_dllu.jpg/399px-View_of_Empire_State_Building_from_Rockefeller_Center_New_York_City_dllu.jpg" >
        <p>Like every city, New York has a lot of good things going for it and a few not-so-great things as well.</p>
        <h3 class="key-word">THE GOOD</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-Stop Action:</strong> There is a reason they call it the city that never sleeps.</li>
            <li><strong>Food:</strong> NYC is one of the best “foodie” cities in the world. You can find just about everything you’re looking for.</li>
            <li><strong>The Sights:</strong> New York is packed with sights and attractions. You won’t be able to fit everything in and you won’t get bored.</li>
            <li><strong>Culture:</strong> Museum, shows, live music, fashion… it’s all here.</li>
            <li><strong>The Subway:</strong> Ok… Europe’s subways are generally better than New York’s but it is still pretty good.</li>
            <li><strong>The Shopping:</strong> You want it? Someone in NYC is selling it.</li>
            <li><strong>Central Park:</strong> NY’s massive Central Park makes escaping the insanity of the city easy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="key-word">THE BAD</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Prices:</strong> NYC is expensive. The food, the drinks, the hotels, the museums… It’s hard to stick to a reasonable budget.</li>
           <li><strong>The Number Of People:</strong> The sheer number of people in NYC gives the city energy. But it also makes everything crowded (i.e. the subway during rush hour, the shops, the streets, the train stations…). But it also makes getting a table at a popular restaurant a pain. So expect to adjust your expectations.</li>             <li><strong>Lack Of Space:</strong> The hotels and restaurants are tiny so expect to be rubbing elbows with your neighbors.</li>
            <li><strong>Airports:</strong> They’re all pretty bad and they don’t make getting into the city very easy either.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="second-post">HOW LONG TO VISIT NYC</h2>
        <p>Honestly, you’ll never run out of things to do in NYC — you’re much more likely to run out of money before you run out of things to do.</p>
        <p>We think four days is the absolute minimum amount of time you should spend in New York. You won’t be able to see much but you can see a handful of the highlights.</p>
        <p>That said, a full week will allow you to see a few different neighborhoods and not feel like you’re rushing around at 1000 miles an hour.</p>
        <h2 id="thrid-post">WHEN TO VISIT NYC</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/26_-_New_York_-_Octobre_2008.jpg/1500px-26_-_New_York_-_Octobre_2008.jpg">
        <p>New York City is buzzing year-round so you’ll never have a lack of things to do. That said, each season possesses negative and positive aspects.</p>
        <h3 class="key-word">SUMMER</h3>
        <p>New York can get quite hot in the summer so walking in the full sun or waiting on the hot subway platforms can be brutal.</p>
        <p>That said, the city is fully alive during the summer. The parks are full, the sidewalk cafes are hopping, the people are out and about until late at night so it’s still an amazing time to visit.</p>
        <h3 class="key-word">SPRING/FALL</h3>
        <p>It’s hard to beat NYC in the spring or fall — the weather is comfortable, the city has plenty of energy, and the crowds aren’t too crazy. Accommodation prices aren’t much different than the peak summer times so you’re not really going to save much money.</p>
        <p>Note: We also love NYC in the fall because the trees in Central Park and along the Hudson river begin to change colors. Truly beautiful.</p>
        <h3 class="key-word">WINTER </h3>
        <p></p>NYC is magical around Christmas with all the fun window displays and decorations. NYC does get cold and it gets a few days of snow every year. We highly recommend a pair of waterproof boots or shoes as the snow quickly turns into massive puddles of slush and muck.
        <p>The period of time between Christmas and spring is cold and grey — but prices are at their lowest for accommodation.</p>
