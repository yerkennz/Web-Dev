        <h1>Travel to Italy</h1>
        <h2>Italy has a free wine fountain</h2>
        <p>A free wine fountain sounds like the stuff of dreams – but it’s a very real thing in Caldari di Ortona in Italy. 
            The small town has a <em>free wine fountain</em> that flows 24-hours a day with locally grown red wine. 
            The fontana di vino can be found in the Dora Sarchese vineyard, which sits on the Italian pilgrimage route of Cammino di San Tommaso.
